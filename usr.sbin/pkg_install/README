$FreeBSD: projects/armv6/usr.sbin/pkg_install/README 232120 2012-02-24 18:39:55Z cognet $

This is the pkg_install suite of tools for doing maintenance of
software "packages".  More documentation is available in the man pages
for each individual command.

This code was written by Jordan Hubbard for FreeBSD, snatched and
mildly reshaped by John Kohl in NetBSD and the changes taken back into
FreeBSD again by Jordan, who then proceeded to add another couple
of dozen features on top.  Whee! :-)
